# Stock Market Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

The **Stock Market Data Analysis and Prediction** project is designed to help analyze historical stock market data and visualize trends, moving averages, volatility, and correlations. It uses Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **mplfinance** to process, analyze, and visualize the data. The project also explores basic stock price prediction models and helps in understanding stock price behaviors over time.

## Project Goals

- **Analyze Stock Market Trends**: Calculate moving averages, volatility, and stock price changes to identify patterns.
- **Visualize Stock Data**: Plot stock prices, moving averages, and volatility using line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts.
- **Understand Key Metrics**: Calculate important stock performance metrics such as daily returns, volatility, and correlations with other financial data.
- **Forecast Stock Prices**: Build basic forecasting models using historical data, focusing on simple approaches like moving averages or more advanced models.

## Key Features

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Fetch stock data using the Yahoo Finance API via the `yfinance` library.
   - Allows users to choose a stock symbol (e.g., Tesla, Apple, Microsoft) and retrieve historical data over a specified date range.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:  
   - Clean missing or incomplete data.
   - Resample data to different time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
   - Perform basic preprocessing like filling missing values and adjusting data formats.

3. **Stock Data Analysis**:
   - **Moving Averages**: Calculate and visualize simple moving averages (SMA) for different periods (e.g., 50-day, 200-day).
   - **Volatility**: Measure stock price volatility using rolling standard deviation over a specified window.
   - **Daily Returns**: Calculate daily percentage changes to track the stock's short-term price movements.
   - **Correlations**: Calculate correlations between different stocks or between stock prices and trading volume.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use **Matplotlib** to visualize stock prices, moving averages, and volatility.
   - Create candlestick charts using the **mplfinance** library to show stock price movements in a more detailed format.
   
5. **Stock Price Forecasting**:
   - Implement simple forecasting techniques such as moving averages and exponential smoothing.
   - More advanced forecasting methods, such as ARIMA or machine learning models, can be explored for predicting future stock prices.
